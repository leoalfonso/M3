    "Anaconda Navigator is a tool to manage various versions of Python by organising them in <i>Environments</i>. It also organises  basic scientific <i>libraries</i> (e.g., Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, etc., which we will explain later). Additionally, Anaconda includes different coding interfaces, such as <b>Jupyter Notebook</b> (what you are using right now), and <b>Spyder IDE</b> (Interactive Development Environment). We will cover the notions of <i>Environments</i>, <i>libraries</i>, <i>Jupyter Notebook</i> and <i>Spyder IDE</i> later on in the course.\n",

    "It is possible that you already have one ore more versions of Python installed in your system. Typically, software such as ArcGIS and QGIS have their own Python installations. Although it can confuse the beginners, it is possible to have several versions of Python in a single machine, independent from each other. \n",

    "![](figures\\Anaconda_download.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now that we know Python is installed,  we need to make sure it is accessible from every path in your laptop. Simply open a command (CMD) window (press Windows+R, type <i>cmd</i>, and hit enter). Type 'python' (all in lowercase) in front of the prompt '>'. \n",
