    "# 1. Objects and Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the course you have been manipulating Python <i>objects</i> such as matplotlib plots and numpy arrays. In fact, every element in Python is actually an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this topic we are going to discuss the general characteristics of objects and classes in Pyhton, exploring the syntax and  implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining a class\n",
    "By definition, classes are composed by <i>methods</i> and <i>attributes</i>. Methods, are understood as tasks which are done by the object, while attributes are information that is stored in the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are defined by using the definition `class` and followed by the parent class in parenthesis, or colon `:`\n",
    "\n",
    "    class MyClass(MyParentClass):\n",
    "    \n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "    class MyClass:\n",
    "    \n",
    "In the process of defining a class, it is necessary to have a <i>constructor</i>. The constructor is a method which will initialise the componenets of the object, once the class is instantiated. The contrusctor in Python is defined as an internal function of name `__init__`, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "    \n",
    "The definition of the `__init__` method will be called once an object is created using the class. It is possible to initialise an empty class by ending with the argument `pass`\n",
    "\n",
    "    class MyClass:\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining object attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Object attributes are always preceeded by the word `self`, indicating that the reference is made to the object to be built, and not to the class. Because of this, variables that are inside the function in the class, but whose name has the `self` syntax, will live as a part of the object, even after the function has finished. Consequently, it is common to avoid the `return` syntax in the methods of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "    self.my_attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods are fundamentally functions. They allow the object to perform actions, which either modify the object itself (mutation), or generate a result. The methods in the class are defined as regular functions, and it is possible to generate calls to internal methods within the object, by using the syntax `self` before the name of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "    def my_method(self):\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, if the method will be using any of the attributes or methods of the object, it is required that the `self` variable is passed before anything else. Keep in mind that this variable is only used in the scope of the object, and therefore, is not required when is being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Private attributes and methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In many prorgamming languages the use of <i>private</i> attributes and methods, -only visible by the object itself, are common. In Python this is not the case, as it is possible to access all of the methods and attributes of the class via the objects. The reason behind private methods and attributes is founded in avoiding confusion and renaming among large data structures, and therefore, avoiding the replacement of other parts of code in large systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, to avoid this, there is a common agreement in which the private variable names are preceeded by an underscore (`_`). It is also possible to internally change the variable by means of *mangling*, by adding a second underscore (`__`):\n",
    "\n",
    "    object._ClassName__variable_name\n",
    "\n",
    "Private variables are not expected to be accessed by users who are not the developers, as these may dissapear without notice. Therefore, its support between program versions is not guaranteed. In other words, these variables are reserved as implementation details only.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining a class, creating objects and using them\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use the analogy about baking cakes, given in the lecture about objects, to facilitate the comprehension on classes and objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Defining a class is like <i>building a baking mold to bake cakes</i>. \n",
    "- Creating an object is like <i>using the mold to bake one or more different cakes, which can have different flavours</i>.\n",

Pipes can have other properties that can be stored in a list, such as the `water_flow` at each time of the day. \n",
