    "We often want to graph functions such as $y=f(x)$; other time we need to plot a series of different functions $y_i=f_i(x)$ in the same graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure to plot is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Decide the domain of the independent variable $x$ (min and max values)\n",
    "2. Decide the number of points that will be used to plot. The higher the number of points the higher the resolution of the graph\n",
    "3. Calculate $y$ based on the values of $x$, using the particular function you are interested on, $y=f(x)$\n",
    "4. Use the `plot` function to plot the pairs $(x,y)$ and connect them\n",
    "5. Optionally, specify line types, colors, markers, titles, axis labels, axis limits, grids, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In step 2, we could use the `range` command to produce a sequence with certain number of points. However, we will be limited to using integers as values of $x$. This is of course not very convenient for most of the mathematical functions. Instead, we can the function `arange`, which works like `range`, but supporting floats. It also comes from the NumPy library:\n",
    "\n",
    "`np.arange(ini, end, step)` \n",
    "\n",
    "where `ini` indicates the initial value of the sequence, `end` indicates the last value, and `step` defines the resolution at which the sequence is discretised."
